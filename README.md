# Mario Kart: Double Dash!! PC Port

## Overview

This project is an experimental reverse engineering and recreation of *Mario Kart: Double Dash!!* with the goal of building a native PC port. It is based on available decompilation efforts and aims to modernize and expand the original experience for PC while preserving its iconic gameplay.

## Objectives

- Port core gameplay logic to PC
- Improve performance and resolution for modern hardware
- Support multiple control inputs (GameCube, Switch Pro, etc.)
- Enable mod support and community enhancements
- Build an optional online play system beyond LAN
- Maintain accuracy with original GameCube behavior

## Current Status

> üöß **Early Development** ‚Äî Setup and testing in progress  
> ‚úÖ Repository initialized  
> ‚úÖ Basic systems tested (weight logic, control flow)  
> ‚è≥ Porting of animation systems and game logic underway
